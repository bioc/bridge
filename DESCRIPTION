Title: Bayesian Robust Inference for Differential Gene Expression
Version: 1.18.0
Author: Raphael Gottardo
Description: Test for differentially expressed genes with microarray
    data. This package can be used with both cDNA microarrays or
    Affymetrix chip. The packge fits a robust Bayesian hierarchical model
    for testing for differential expression. Outliers are modeled
    explicitly using a $t$-distribution. The model includes an
    exchangeable prior for the variances which allow different variances
    for the genes but still shrink extreme empirical variances. Our model
    can be used for testing for differentially expressed genes among
    multiple samples, and can distinguish between the different possible
    patterns of differential expression when there are three or more
    samples. Parameter estimation is carried out using a novel version of
    Markov Chain Monte Carlo that is appropriate when the model puts mass
    on subspaces of the full parameter space.
